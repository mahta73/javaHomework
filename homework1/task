Homework Assignment 1
1. (15 points) Write a Java program that finds and prints the average of four integers. In
order to achieve this, in your program you should:
1) declare and initialise four variables of integer type,
2) calculate and store their sum in a fifth variable named sum,
3) divide the value of sum by 4 and store it in a sixth variable average,
4) print the resulting value with a corresponding message.
Think carefully before choosing the types of sum and average. Test your program on 5
different sets of four integers changing the initialisation values and include your results
in your answer. Does your program always produce a correct answer? If not, reconsider
the types of all six variables and try to explain why the bug occurs. Fix your program to
resolve the bug and test it again on the 5 examples.
2. (10 points) Convert the following numbers from one system to another. Clearly illustrate the conversion process.
(a) (1011100101)2 to decimal
(b) (1100110011000)2 to octal
(c) (101010111000011)2 to hexadecimal
(d) (120)10 to binary
(e) (4096)10 to octal
(f) (31405)10 to hexadecimal
(g) (7063)8 to binary
(h) (3177)8 to decimal
(i) (A5E)16 to binary
(j) (9B1F)16 to decimal
3. (10 points) Explain step-by-step what the code snippet below does and give the values
of the variables after each update. Make sure that your explanation is detailed.
1 int x, y;
2 int z = 98;
3 x = ++z;
4 y = x++;
5 boolean first = (y == x);
6 boolean second = x == y + 1 && y == z + 1;
7 x = ~ z + 1;
8 boolean third = x >= 0 || x + z == 0;
9 boolean fourth = !third;
10 System.out.println("x = " + x + "; y = " + y + "; z = " + z + ";");
11 System.out.println("first = " + first + "; second = " + second + ";");
12 System.out.println("third = " + third + "; fourth = " + fourth + ";");
13 y = z | x;
14 z >>= 2;
15 x = y * 1000 % z;
16 System.out.println("x = " + x + "; y = " + y + "; z = " + z + ";");

4. (25 points) For each of the code snippets below explain what they do. Support your
explanation with a detailed step-by-step description (including numerical representation,
if needed) of the calculation process.
(a) int a = 15;
int b = -36;
int tmp = a;
a = b;
b = tmp;
(b) int a = 45;
int b = 10;
a = a ^ b;
b = a ^ b;
a = a ^ b;
a = a + b;
b = a - b;
a = a - b;
(c) int a = 192;
int b = 12;
int c = a & -a;
int d = b & -b;
System.out.println("The results are " + c + " and " + d);
(d) int a = 10;
int b = 128;
int c = a & (a - 1);
int d = b & (b - 1);
System.out.println("The results are " + c + " and " + d);
(e) int a = 1;
int b = 128;
a <<= 6;
b <<= 2;
System.out.println("The results are " + a + " and " + b);
5. (5 points) Determine the value of the expression by first constructing the two’s complement representation of the operands and then performing the bitwise operation on
them.
(a) 510 & -2050
(b) -500 | 12345
(c) 15 ^ (~70)
(d) -201 >> 3
(e) -201 >>> 4

6. (10 points) Write a Java program that inputs the radius of a circle and outputs its
circumference and its area.
7. (25 points) Write a Java program that inputs three lines of text and for each line of
the input text outputs that line of text with all occurrences of “apple” changed to “pear”
and the last occurrence of “plum” changed to “apricot”. For example, the line
I like plums. This apple is red but those apples are green.
should be changed to
I like apricots. This pear is red but those pears are green.
If the word “plum” occurs more than once in the line, your program will replace only the
last occurrence of “plum”.
