/*
    (10 points) Write a Java program that inputs the radius of a circle and outputs its
    circumference and its area. Your program should consist of two files:
    • Circle.java, containing the definition of the Circle class with corresponding instance variables, constructors and methods;
    • CircleDemo.java, containing the demo class with the main method that illustrates
    the use of the Circle class.
    If both files are put in the same directory (folder) compiling and running CircleDemo.java
    in the usual way, i.e. javac CircleDemo.java; java CircleDemo should work.
